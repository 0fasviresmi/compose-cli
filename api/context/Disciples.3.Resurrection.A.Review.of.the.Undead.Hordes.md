Disciples 3 Resurrection is a game for fans of strategy RPGs who enjoy dark and gloomy settings, challenging battles and complex stories. The game is available to buy as a full version or as part of the Disciples 3 Gold Edition package, which includes Disciples 3 Renaissance and Disciples 3 Resurrection[^4^] [^5^]. The game can be downloaded from Steam or other online platforms.

The gameplay of Disciples 3 Resurrection is similar to Disciples 3 Renaissance, but with some improvements and changes. The game is divided into two modes: adventure mode and combat mode. In adventure mode, the player can explore the world map, interact with other characters, collect resources, build structures, recruit units and perform quests. In combat mode, the player can engage in turn-based battles with enemies, using different skills and spells. The game also features a new magic system, with dozens of new global spells that can affect the whole map.
 
The game allows the player to choose from two storyline characters: Mortem or Resus. Mortem is a powerful necromancer who leads the Undead Hordes in their quest for vengeance. Resus is a former human knight who was resurrected by Mortis and now serves her faithfully. The player can also choose from four leaders of the Undead Hordes: Haarhus, a fallen dwarf who commands the undead dwarves; Bethrezen, a fallen angel who leads the fallen legions; Morticia, a vampire queen who rules over the bloodsuckers; and Gallean, a fallen elf who controls the corrupted nature. Each leader has their own unique units, skills and abilities.
 
The game also features two bosses: Soloniel and Uther. Soloniel is a powerful archangel who opposes the Undead Hordes and tries to stop them from reaching the new star. Uther is a legendary human hero who was killed by Mortem and now seeks revenge against him. The player will have to face these formidable foes in epic battles that will decide the fate of Nevendaar.

The game has received mixed or average reviews from critics and users, according to Metacritic[^1^]. Some of the positive aspects of the game are the rich and dark atmosphere, the variety and uniqueness of the Undead Hordes units, the challenging and strategic battles, and the long and engaging campaign. Some of the negative aspects of the game are the technical issues, such as bugs and crashes, the lack of voice acting and animations, the repetitive and tedious quests, and the unbalanced difficulty and AI.
 
The game is recommended for fans of the Disciples series who want to experience a new race and a new story in the world of Nevendaar. The game is also suitable for fans of strategy RPGs who enjoy turn-based combat and complex gameplay mechanics. However, the game is not recommended for casual gamers who prefer more action-oriented and fast-paced games, or for gamers who expect high-quality graphics and sound.
 
Disciples 3 Resurrection is a game that offers a lot of content and challenge for a reasonable price. It is a game that requires patience and dedication, but also rewards the player with a satisfying and immersive experience. It is a game that has its flaws and limitations, but also its strengths and charms. It is a game that deserves a try by anyone who loves strategy RPGs and dark fantasy settings.
