Gauranga's Mission and Preaching: After his transformation at Gaya, Gauranga returned to Nabadwip and started preaching the Bhakti cult. He organized a group of devotees who sang and danced with him in ecstasy. He propagated the chanting of the holy names of Lord Krishna - Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare - as the easiest and most effective means of attaining God-realization in this age of Kali. He emphasized that anyone, regardless of caste, creed, or gender, can practice this method and attain the highest perfection of life.
  
Gauranga also taught that Lord Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead, the source of all other incarnations and manifestations. He explained that Krishna has unlimited forms and qualities, and that he performs various pastimes for the pleasure of his devotees. He revealed that Krishna's most intimate and loving aspect is his relationship with his consort Radha, who represents the supreme devotion and surrender to him. He also expounded on the philosophy and theology of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, based on the scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita, the Srimad Bhagavatam, and the Vedanta Sutra.
  
Gauranga's Travels and Associates: Gauranga traveled extensively throughout India, visiting holy places and spreading his message. He visited Vrindavan, the land of Krishna's pastimes, where he discovered many lost places associated with Krishna. He also visited Varanasi, Prayag, Mathura, Dwaraka, Pandharpur, Udupi, Tirupati, Kanchipuram, Rameswaram, Jagannath Puri, and many other places. He met many saints and scholars of different traditions and converted many of them to his path of devotion. Some of his prominent associates were Advaita Acharya, Nityananda Prabhu, Gadadhara Pandit, Srivas Thakur, Haridas Thakur, Rupa Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Raghunath Das Goswami, Jiva Goswami, Ramananda Raya, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, Prakashananda Saraswati, and King Prataparudra.
  
Gauranga's Final Years and Disappearance: Gauranga spent his final years in Jagannath Puri, where he lived in the house of Kashi Mishra. He spent most of his time in a state of divine ecstasy, immersed in the love of Radha and Krishna. He often exhibited symptoms of transcendental emotion such as crying, laughing, shivering, fainting, and changing bodily colors. He sometimes revealed his identity as Krishna himself or as Radha-Krishna combined. He also composed some beautiful prayers and songs expressing his devotion to Krishna.
  
Gauranga disappeared from this world in 1534 at the age of 48. He entered into the deity of Lord Jagannath in front of his devotees. His disappearance day is celebrated by his followers on the Phalguna Purnima (full moon day) according to the lunar calendar.
